Without any further delay, let‚Äôs jump into the review.</p>

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <p>Breaking down each of these features will help give you a better idea of how their system works:</p>
    
    <div class="file-name">
     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">üî∑ Logo Library</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight"><p>The first thing you‚Äôll be greeted with, post the home screen and registration process, is Design Evo‚Äôs expensive library of premade logo designs. Every logo you create with their toolset will start with one of the thousands of options available here. They are organized based on the category they fit best with, and the page itself has plenty of functionality to help you search and find the right logo for you and your brand.</p>

    <div class="file-name">
     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">üî∑ Logo Designer</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>Once you‚Äôve selected one of the available options you‚Äôll be prompted to give a name (optionally) and slogan (again option) for your logo. Once you enter those two things you‚Äôre off to the races with their design tool. They give you a good amount of control over the selected logo. Everything from color, size, and position are under your control. You are also able to change fonts and add or remove any of the graphical assets they provide to you in the helpful sidebar. After that, you‚Äôll move on to the download section of the site.<p>

     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">üî∑ Download & Edit</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>You have three options once you‚Äôve completed your design. You can use the free version of the logo you just created, or purchase one of the two premium choices that are made available to you (We‚Äôll be covering these parts in more depth in the review section of this article)</p>
    <img src="/images/designevo/download.jpg" alt="designevo's download & edit feature" />
    </div>

    <br>
    
    <h2 id="whatsgood">What's It Good For?</h2>
    
    <h3 id="usecases">Use Cases</h3>
    
    <p>In short, Design Evo Excels in speedy creation at a low cost. Rather than spending hours trying to find a logo designer and then paying anywhere from 100-1000 dollars for them to design you a logo from scratch you simply follow the steps provided and get a high-quality logo that you can use anywhere from the web to prints.</p>
    
    <p>In essence, its good for smaller businesses and personal use.</p>
    <!-- <h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
    <p>Each step in the process shown above can be difficult in itself, and there are many tools built around optimizing each of these steps. In this case, Wishpond has created an entire tool suite to handle optimization and creation of each of these steps. </p>
    <p>The main benefit of using a software tool suite such as this is the ease of integration between each tool. Normally you would need to go out and buy each individual tool to start optimizing and piecing together your marketing campaign. Because they‚Äôre all bundled together, moving from lead to rapport building to pitching a sale becomes infinitely easier.</p>
    
    <h3 id="notgood">Not Good At</h3>
    <p>But, what about the bad side of bundling all these tools together? Well, in this case, we can see that some of the tools in Wishpond‚Äôs software suite can lack a little bit in advanced functionality. The landing page designer and popup form creator are great for design but lack advanced features like analytics integrations.</p>
    <p>As for their Marketing Automation, you will find that you want to integrate with a more pronounced email marketing tool like Constant Contact, Aweber or MailChimp. </p>
    <p>Overall, the software suite has a lot of great tools and surprisingly have a lot of polish. So there isn't much bad to say here.</p> -->
    
    <h2 id="review">Design Evo Review</h2>

    <h3 id="experience">My Experience</h3>
    <p>As I previously stated, I‚Äôve used Design Evo a LOT. I‚Äôve created around eight different logos using their site and it‚Äôs been indispensable for the work that I do. I‚Äôm required to frequently make new sites and branding graphics to go along with them and Design Evo prevents me from needing to pull up a blank page on photoshop every time the need for a logo arrises.</p>

    <h3>Purchase Options</h3>
    <p>For the most part, the basic $25 package is what I use. It gives you the transparent background (which is basically required for web applications) as well as a higher resolution image and editability, which is not available on the free version. They also have a $50 premium option, but I would only recommend that option for those that need a vector graphic version of your logo.</p>
    
    <h3 id="whofor">Who Is It For?</h3>
    
    <p>We recommend Design Evo for those of you who aren't designers and need some nice premade logos to use and for those designers who are limited by time.
    </p>

    <p><b>‚úîÔ∏è Benefits:</b></p>
    <p>As I previously stated, it‚Äôs lower cost and faster than many other logo design options, but that doesn‚Äôt really mean you lose quality. You will need to spend a bit of time, and preferably have an eye for basic design in order to produce something professional grade. However, even if that‚Äôs not the case, you can easily just recolor a predesigned logo and still get an awesome end result.</p>
    
    <p><b>‚ùå Negatives:</b></p>
    <p>Where Design Evo falls short is being 100% unique. Of course, many people have access to this tool and as a result, there is the possibility that you will use a logo that is already being used by someone else. For the most part, this isn‚Äôt an issue, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind.</p>
    <p>You also don‚Äôt get full control like you would from creating a logo from scratch, and you have to do most of the dirty work yourself if you want to make edits.</p>

    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
    <p>It‚Äôs a good service. I like it and that‚Äôs why I use it so often. It keeps things simple, and it saves a butt-ton of time and money. I‚Äôve yet to find a more comprehensive logo design tool on the web that doesn‚Äôt require you to create the logo yourself.</p>
